/* This code example requires two SPI ports, one as master and the other one 
 * as slave. Set the SPI_MODE macro depending on the kit. Some kits support two 
 * SPI ports which you can configure in SPI_MODE_BOTH whereas some support only
 * one port in which case you can configure the kit in either SPI_MODE_MASTER or 
 * SPI_MODE_SLAVE. See README.md to know more on the kit specific configuration.
